## Project
In Holwerd, there is a plan to reconnect the village to the sea by means of breaking the dyke and creating a salt water lake. This initiative is called "Holwerd aan Zee".

One of the research questions is what the effect of the salt water lake will be on the soil salinity of the agricultural fields in the vicinity of the salt water lake. Our project focusses on anwsering this research question by means of remote sensing techniques.

## How to use the script
Via Google Earth Engine, sentinel images of 16 dates in 2019 of the study area are downloaded into the desktop. The
